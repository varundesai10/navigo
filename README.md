# Project i4: NAVIGO

# An overview

This app was made as a solution for problem posed by Reasearch & Development, IIT Delhi. The problem takes the form of a traveling salesman problem, and the challenge is to develop a user interface that the government or any other stakeholder can use to assign a set of stops and associated demand to a set of delivery agents, based on their capacity and to develop an optimal route for each delivery agent. The web app was based on Flask framework and used tools such as IBM ILOG CPLEX.
